    "# The importance of space\n",
    "Agent based models are useful when the aggregate system behavior emerges out of local interactions amongst the agents. In the model of the evolution of cooperation, we created a set of agents and let all agents play against all other agents. Basically, we pretended as if all our agents were perfectly mixed. In practice, however, it is much more common that agents only interact with some, but not all, other agents. For example, in models of epidemiology, social interactions are a key factors. Thus, interactions are dependend on your social network. In other situations, our behavior might be based on what we see around us. Phenomena like fashion are at least partly driven by seeing what others are doing and mimicking this behavior. The same is true for many animals. Flocking dynamics as exhibited by starling, or shoaling behavior in fish, can be explained by the animal looking at its neirest neighbors and staying within a given distance of them. In agent based models, anything that structures the interaction amongst agents is typically called a space. This space can be a 2d or 3d space with euclidian distances (as in models of flocking and shoaling), it can also be a grid structure (as we will show below), or it can be a network structure. \n",
    "\n",
    "MESA comes with several spaces that we can readily use. These are\n",
    "\n",
    "* **SingleGrid;** an 'excel-like' space with each agent occopying a single grid cell\n",
    "* **MultiGrid;** like grid, but with more than one agent per grid cell\n",
    "* **HexSingleGrid;** like SingleGrid, but on a hexagonal grid (*e.g.*, the board game Catan) thus changing who your neighbours are\n",
    "* **HexMultiGrid;** like MultiGrid, but on a hexagonal grid (*e.g.*, the board game Catan) thus changing who your neighbours are\n",
    "* **ConinuousSpace;** a 2d continous space were agents can occupy any coordinate\n",
    "* **NetworkGrid;** a network structure were one or more agents occupy a given node.\n",
    "\n",
    "A key concern when using a none-networked space, is to think carefull about what happens at the edges of the space. In a basic implementation, agents in for example the top left corner has only 2 neighbors, while an agent in the middle has four neighbors. This can give rise to artifacts in the results. Basically, the dynamics at the edges are different from the behavior further away from the edges. It is therefore quite common to use a torus, or donut, shape for the space. In this way, there is no longer any edge and artifacts are thus removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# The emergence of cooperation in space\n",
    "The documentation of MESA on the different spaces is quite limited. Therefore, this assignment is largely a tutorial continuing on the evolution of cooperation. \n",
    "\n",
    "We make the following changes to the model\n",
    "\n",
    "* Each agent gets a position, which is an x,y coordinate indicating the grid cell the agent occupies\n",
    "* The model has a grid, with an agent of random class. We initialize the model with equal probabilities for each type of class\n",
    "* All agents play against their neighbors. On a grid, neighborhood can be defined in various ways. Below, we use a neighborhood distance of 1, and we do include diagonal neighbors.\n",
    "* The evolutionary dynamic, after all agents having played, is that each agent compares its scores to its neighbors. It will adopt whichever strategy within its neighborhood performed best.\n",
    "* Next to using a Grid from MESA, we also use a DataCollector to handle collecting statistics.\n",
    "\n",

    "The basic schedule of this model is that each agent will play against all its neighbors. This can be achieved in more then one way. If we would use one of MESA's off the shelf schedulers (e.g., BaseScheduler), the logic of identifying neighbors and playing against them would have to be moved into the agent's step method. This however would break consistency with assignment 1. So, instead, we create our own custom scheduler by extending (i.e., subclassing) the BaseScheduler from MESA. Within this scheduler's step method, we loop over all agents and for each agent over all its neighbors. The AxelrodAgent step method then stays the same as in assignment 1.\n",

    "In the `__init__`, we now instantiate a SingleGrid, with a specified width and height. We set the kwarg torus to True indicating we are using a donut shape grid to avoid edge effects. Next, we fill this grid with random agents of the different types. This can be implemented in various ways. What I do here is using a list with the different classes (*i.e.*, types of strategies). By drawing a random number from a unit interval, multiplying it with the lenght of the list of classes and flooring the resulting number to an integer, I now have a random index into this list with the different classes. Next, I can get the class from the list and instantiate the agent object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some minor points with instantiating the agents. First, we give the agent a position, called pos, this is a default attribute assumed by MESA. We also still need a unique ID for the agent, we do this with a simple counter (`self.agent_id`). `self.grid.coord_iter` is a method on the grid. It returns an iterator over the cells in the grid. This iterator returns the agent occupying the cell and the x and y coordinate. Since the first item is `null` because we are filling the grid, we can ignore this. We do this by using the underscore variable name (`_`). This is a python convention. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have instantiated the agent, we place the agent in the grid and add it to our collection of agents. If you look in more detail at the model class, you will see that I use a set for agents, rather than a list. The reason for this is that we are going to remove agents in the evolutionary phase. Removing agents from a list is memory and compute intensive, while it is computationally easy and cheap when we have a set. \n",

    "We also use a DataCollector. This is a default class provided by MESA that can be used for keeping track of relevant statistics. It can store both model level variables as well as agent level variables. Here we are only using model level variables (i.e. attributes of the model). Specifically, we are going to have an attribute on the model for each type of agent strategy (i.e. classes). This attribute is the current count of agents in the grid of the specific type. To implement this, we need to do several things.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. initialize a data collector instance\n",
    "2. at every step update the current count of agents of each strategy\n",
    "3. collect the current counts with the data collector.\n",
    "\n",
    "For step 1, we set a DataCollector as an attribute. This datacollector needs to know the names of the attributes on the model it needs to collect. So we pass a dict as kwarg to model_reporters. This dict has as key the name by which the variable will be known in the DataCollector. As value, I pass the name of the attribute on the model, but it can also be a function or method which returns a number. Note that the ``klass`` misspelling is deliberate. The word ``class`` is protected in Python, so you cannot use it as a variable name. It is common practice to use ``klass`` instead in the rare cases were you are having variable refering to a specific class.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "self.datacollector = DataCollector(model_reporters={klass.__name__:klass.__name__\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For step 2, we need to count at every step the number of agents per strategy type. To help keep track of this, we define a new method, `count_agent_types`. The main magic is the use of `setattr` which is a standard python function for setting attributes to a particular value on a given object. This reason for writing our code this way is that we automatically adapt our attributes to the classes of agents we have, rather than hardcoding the agent classes as attributes on our model. If we now add new classes of agents, we don't need to change the model code itself. There is also a ``getattr`` function, which is used by for example the DataCollector to get the values for the specified attribute names. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def count_agent_types(self):\n",
    "    counter = Counter()\n",
    "    for agent in self.agents:\n",
    "        counter[agent.__class__.__name__] += 1\n",
    "\n",
    "    for k,v in counter.items():\n",
    "        setattr(self, k, v)    \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For step 3, we modify the first part of the ``step`` method. We first count the types of agents and next collect this data with the datacollector, and then ask the scheduler to perform the next step of the model.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "self.count_agent_types()\n",
    "self.datacollector.collect(self)\n",
    "self.schedule.step()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, we have to add the evolutionary dynamic. This is a bit tricky. First, we loop again over all agents in the model. We check its neighbors and see which strategy performed best. If this is of a different type (``not isinstance(agent_a, best_strategy)``, we add it to a list of agents that needs to be changed and the type of agent to which it needs to be changed. Once we know all agents that need to be changed, we can make this change. \n",
    "\n",
    "Making the change is quite straighforward. We remove the agent from the set of agents (`self.agents`) and from the grid. Next we get the position of the agent, we increment our unique ID counter, and create a new agent. This new agent is than added to the grid and to the set of agents. \n",
